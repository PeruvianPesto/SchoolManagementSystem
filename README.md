This is my Advanced Java Final Project! (group project but I wrote 90% of the code)

Basically, a Canvas clone that is suppose to streamline and simplify the administration for a school.

Technologies Used:

Java (primary programming language)
JavaFX (for building the graphical user interface)
MySQL (with MySQL Connector/J for database connectivity)

Would have been a fun project if my group did stuff ngl :/
